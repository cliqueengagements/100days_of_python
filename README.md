# 100days Of Python

This is my 100days python challenge from basic concepts to advance. I initially started this challenge on <a href ="https://replit.com/@cliqueengagemen">Replit.</a>
Over the next 100days, I would use each concept on a project basis: then dive imto a full project to practice and have fun while coding in python.
I do encourage collaborations from python enthusiasts willing to take out time to help me get better at the language and build something great from scratch.ðŸ˜Ž
